### Request Runner
To be marked as a runner, you must have a rank in the channel chat. 
In order to ping a runner, you simply type the following anywhere in a message to the channel chat: **@runner**

When a runner is request, all online runners will have a notification flash on the top of their screen to let them know.

### Set Client
To set a client, right-click on a player and select "Set as Client" 
When you have a client set, they will have a different color than the other chat messages

In order to do that, you must have "Split Clan Messages" set to true. This will display your channel chat above your normal text window using the colors set in the config. 
You can also set the client filter to true. Doing so will filter out anything that isn't said by you or your client

### Trading
When someone trades with you, it will spam the trade chat to make it easier to initiate the trade.
Additionally, it changes the default click when trading to offer all.
